# Wordle Pattern Generator

Word Pattern Generator is an app that generates a per-row pattern for the wordle game. Currently, it only supports either green/yellow, or blank squares.

The main algorithm for this app was made using Replit, with minimal human interference. The interface was hand-coded.

# HOW TO USE

Visit the netlify site at https://wordle-pattern.netlify.app/. To use the app, input the current Wordle word in the "Daily word" field (you will have to look it up manually), then press the five squares until you get a desired pattern, and press the "Find Words" button. This will show up to five words that fit your pattern.
